//write a javascript program to generate a random number and store it in a variable. The program then takes a input from user to tell them wheather the guess was correct, greater or lower than the original number.100-(number of guess) is the score of the user . The program is expected to terminate once the number is guessed . Number should  be betwwen 1-100




let r = Math.floor(Math.random() * 101);
let g;
let c=0;

while(r!=g){
g= prompt("Enter a number")
  g= Number.parseInt(g)

if (r==g)
{
  alert("your guess is correct")
}
else if (r>g)
{
  alert( "Wrong! Actual number is greater than your guess")
}
else if (r<g)
{
  alert ("Wrong! Actual number is lower than your guess" )
}
else{
  alert("Hehe")
}
  c++;
}
console.log(`you guessed the number in ${c}`)
console.log(`So your point is 100 - ${c} = ` + (100 - c) + " points")

// console.log("Done")
